xCGI
====

C library for handling CGI requests, written in 1996.

Originally written for iQuest Internet, it was the basis for a few different utilities.

This code has been unmaintained for 16 years, and is not safe for production use.  I suspect there are multiple vulnerabilities in this code.

DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR PRODUCTION, DO NOT CONSIDER THIS CODE A GOOD SAMPLE OF MODERN CODING PRACTICE.  It was written by a 20 year old with 1 year of computer science experience.
